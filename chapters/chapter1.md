<exercise id="2" title="Printing">

How can you make Python display the result of 4! to the screen?

<choice>
<opt text="`print 4*3*2*1`">

This will not work. In modern Python, `print` is a function. You must put its
argument inside brackets.

</opt>

<opt text="`print(3*2*2)`" correct="true">

Correct! This is, of course, a silly way of writing `print(4*3*2*1)`.

</opt>

<opt text="`print(4*3*1*1)`">

This is wrong: read the argument passed in carefully.

</opt>
</choice>

<exercise id="3" title="First steps">

This is a code exercise. The content can be formatted in simple Markdown – so
you can have **bold text**, `code` or [links](https://spacy.io) or lists, like
the one for the instructions below.

- These are instructions and they can have bullet points.
- The code block below will look for the files `exc_01_03`, `solution_01_03` and
  `test_01_03` in `/exercises`.

<codeblock id="01_03">

This is a hint.
