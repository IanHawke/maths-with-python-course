# Notes to self

* Making mathjax work on slides etc required fiddling with some of the javascript; take a look at commits from May 8.
* To get matplotlib to display you need a `%matplotlib inline` up front.
* Question: how do we inject code into binder before the solution (eg, the `%matplotlib inline` call and maybe setting default stylings)?
