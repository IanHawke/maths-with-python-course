# Maths with Python: Exercises and tests

This should run exercises associated with the
[Maths with Python](https://github.com/IanHawke/maths-with-python) course,
which you can also
[find in JupyterBook form](https://github.com/IanHawke/maths-with-python-book).

This repository is using the
[course framework](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) of
[Ines Montani](https://github.com/ines) developed and used for their
[spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) ðŸ’–

See the
[course framework README](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) for
details on how to deploy.
